# GoShell ‚Äì A Custom Shell in Golang  

GoShell is a custom shell implemented in **Go**, designed to explore how shells interact with the operating system. It supports **built-in commands**, **external commands**, and **piping**.

I built this project to understand the underlying concepts of process management, system calls, and command execution in Unix-like environments.

## Features  
- **Built-in Commands**: `cd`, `exit`, and more.  
- **External Commands**: Run standard commands like `ls`, `cat`, etc.  
- **Command Piping**: Connect commands using `|` just like in Bash.  
- **Lightweight Prompt**: Simple interface focusing on functionality.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works  
- Reads user input.  
- Parses commands and detects pipes.  
- Executes built-ins directly.  
- Spawns external processes using Go‚Äôs `os/exec` package.  
- Connects commands via `io.Pipe()` for piping functionality.

This helped me understand **how shells interpret and execute commands** at a low level.
